# Disposable email provider list 

## What does this project do

This project lists all providers of temporary/disposable email addresses. The purpose of this list is to have collection of all of the providers in one place so that their pages can be scraped in the future in order to extract a list of domains they are giving out.

Temporary email providers add new domains on a daily basis and by having a list of all of them in one place will make the automation process a lot easier. 

The end goal is to have an automated process that will daily scrape the websites of all providers and automatically update the disposable email lists such as https://github.com/wesbos/burner-email-providers and https://github.com/disposable/disposable

## What this list doesn't include

The project does not list all of the domain names that temporary email providers are giving out. This will be published in the future.

## How to contribute

If you identify a domain that is not in the list, open an issue and the URL will be added after a manual verification. At the moment, this list is being manually updated by me.
